These GLMs represent old class files from a course given on GridLAB-D version
2.0 (or possibly older).

These files are kept for "posterity reasons" only (or for references).  For
actual example files or training, users are encouraged to look into the
/Tutorial or OnlineTutorial_v22 files (or later courses, as they are added).
